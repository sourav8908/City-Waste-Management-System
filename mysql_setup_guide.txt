MYSQL SETUP GUIDE FOR WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
=============================================

This guide will help you set up the MySQL database and view the user table data.

STEP 1: INSTALL MYSQL
--------------------
1. Download MySQL: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/
2. Run the installer and follow the instructions
3. Remember the root password you set during installation!

STEP 2: RUN THE SQL SCRIPT
-------------------------
1. Open Command Prompt/PowerShell with administrative privileges
2. Navigate to your MySQL bin directory (typically C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin)
3. Log in to MySQL:
   mysql -u root -p
   (Enter your root password when prompted)

4. Once logged in, run the database script using one of these methods:

   Option 1: Copy and paste the entire script content directly into the MySQL terminal
   
   Option 2: Run the script from file:
   source B:/Weaste_management/WasteManagementSystem/database.sql
   (Adjust the path according to your actual file location)

STEP 3: VIEW USER TABLE DATA
---------------------------
After running the script, you can view the users table with these commands:

1. Make sure you're using the correct database:
   USE waste_management;

2. View all users:
   SELECT * FROM users;

3. View specific user details:
   SELECT id, username, name, address, phone_number, email, role FROM users;

4. Find a specific user by username:
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'yourUsername';

STEP 4: VIEW COMPLAINTS TABLE DATA
--------------------------------
You can also check the complaints data:

1. View all complaints:
   SELECT * FROM complaints;

2. View complaints with user details:
   SELECT c.id, c.complaint_type, c.description, c.status, c.created_date, 
          u.name, u.phone_number
   FROM complaints c
   JOIN users u ON c.user_id = u.id;

SAMPLE QUERIES
-------------
- Find all complaints made by a specific user:
  SELECT * FROM complaints WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE username = 'user1');

- Count the number of complaints by status:
  SELECT status, COUNT(*) as count FROM complaints GROUP BY status;

- Find the most recent complaints:
  SELECT * FROM complaints ORDER BY created_date DESC LIMIT 5;

- Find all users who have made complaints:
  SELECT DISTINCT u.* FROM users u JOIN complaints c ON u.id = c.user_id;

NOTES
-----
- The default admin credentials are:
  Username: admin
  Password: admin123

- Sample user credentials:
  Username: user1
  Password: user123

- If you want to add a new user through SQL:
  INSERT INTO users (username, password, name, address, phone_number, email, role)
  VALUES ('newuser', 'password123', 'New User', 'Your Address', '1234567890', 'email@example.com', 'user');
